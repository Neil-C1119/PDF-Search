# PDF-Search
A python script I made to search Google for .pdfs

Pip Dependencies (Kinda):
  colorama
  wget
  google
  requests

This program uses Google's API to search for .pdfs and download them automatically.

You type in the name of a .pdf you'd like to find and the amount of .pdfs to download, and the program will show you which .pdf urls will be downloaded. It then either creates a folder to download them into or adds them to an existing folder.
